# runway_work_generation

this repository is made to generate encodings from noise. 
Encodings of 128d which are similary to face encodings generated using face_recognition by Adam Geitgey using open source Dlib
using tsv made by Adam Novak
encodings are precharged using face_recognition my by Adam Geitgey and Dlib made by Davis E. King  


STEP 1 :

download data from https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1G-wDgt53uMumvj34BoSyb_QF3ioAFTtd you will find about 14000 faces images


STEP 2 :

modify GAN settings 


STEP 3 :

modify data path and saving path


STEP 3 :

you can train the GAN using different configurations by running file gen_enco.py


STeP 4 :

reuse the model to generate encodings of faces
